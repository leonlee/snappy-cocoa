# Snappy Cocoa 

This is a shameless "port" of the compressor algorithm snappy from Google to Objective-C++.

The original project can be found here: ([*Snappy: A fast compressor/decomnpressor*]http://code.google.com/p/snappy/)
This version is based on snappy-1.4

I added basically an XCode project around the source files, so compilation with newest XCode 4.2 is smooth.
Additionally the autotools stuff has been removed.

The project is set to iOS 5.0 but it shouldn't be hard to change it to any other iOS or MAC OS X version.



Have fun.

Daniel Schnell.
